1)Constructs representing ideal method of recovering old world. (Compatible with 

Example constructs:

Wrath - 
“If you don’t align with what’s ideal, why should I let you live? You’ll only delay the ideal by working against me.”

Ideal is sort of similar to using brute strength to bring back former, glorious past, but more along the lines of “if you aren’t with me, you are against me.” Since anything that it views as against him are immediately seen as opponents, he usually resorts to violence in order to, what he thinks, progress to the ideal. In his mind, by culling people unaligned with him, he’s chipping away little by little of anything that will pull away from his ideal.
Now besides expunging potential threats, what does he do? How does he progress? While this is one facet of him, he strongly believes that culling and strengthening himself or his forces will allow him to tackle what’s below the Wave. It’s still ambiguous what’s under there; some think it’s raw energy expanding and shrinking on itself. Others like Wrath think it’s a strong, power hungry creature that can only be defeated by raw strength.
In practice, he gets stronger by defeating who or what he perceives as enemies. Since his belief is that strong, he actually does strengthen when he’s victorious. Think of an RPG protagonist, except bloodthirsty and wanting to strengthen himself or his forces at any moment.

Patience/Sloth -
“There is nothing we can do now. We must pause and find the right moment to act; it’s better to save our energy than burn brightly when it is futile.”

Ideal is to wait until the Wave settles. Constructs last a while, and by strengthening his belief, he grows stronger the longer he waits. Debating on making him passive or hostile from the get-go. If the latter, could make it so either if you attempt to disturb him he turns into an enemy or have him appear later when the story develops, gaining strength from biding his time. Think of a monk meditating to gain power, except he’s spending quite a long time to get there. Think centuries at minimum.

2.The protagonist is the last construct. The antagonist is what is below the Wave.

This is more general and not as interesting, but is an option if development time is strained. In this scenario, the Wave is ambiguous and its form is described to the protagonist in various forms by the locals. The Wave will send out small, calamitous things every now and then to violently subsume the protagonist. Said things are devoid of personality and merely act on the will of the Wave. If 1) falls out of favor, could reuse its assets for parts of 2).

3)Protagonist is former antagonist from the past.

For this, the protagonist was once a tool for subjugation. After finding itself in the future, lost of memory, the only constructs he finds are dead or repurposed ones. The repurposed ones also have a faulty memory, but see kinship with protagonist. Throughout the adventure, it meets people and things that bring a bit more life to the landscape. While some may be enemies, the rest make it worth it. Maybe through these meetings the MC can piece what it once was. When coming upon its terrible past, it has the opportunity to reject it and potentially sacrifice itself so that the lands above the Wave continue to flourish, and maybe piece itself back together.
This scenario can easily not be as interesting or impactful if spoiler is exposed too early.

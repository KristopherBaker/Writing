Buzzing

(Background character workshopping, potential side-antagonist journal. Context is after the main events have occurred and have caused much to be awry)

My mind is going to buzz again.

I hate it when it happens.

It’s subtle, but slowly creeps up my neck.

Soon after, it reaches my mind.

When it’s there, it tells me what to do.

Sometimes I refuse.

Other times…I can’t refuse.

I still debate if I was fortunate that the world stopped.

For one, I don’t have to worry about hurting anyone by accident.

On the other, I have no one.

Considering most of everyone’s gone, I can shack up pretty much anywhere.

But there rarely was anyone, wherever I went.

A strong part of me wants to make friends.

The same part knows that they’re safer away from me.

If I know of anyone, then it will know of them too.

I can’t make friends or else…

…It’s almost here.

Might as well get comfortable…

…

…

Friends? You don’t need friends.

You know exactly what you need, but keep denying it.

You long for it.

You crave it.

It’s been far too long.

The sweet music has been silent for months.

…

…oh don’t feel pity, you imbecile.

You are the maestro while I am merely the baton.

I wouldn’t be here if you didn’t let me grow.

Your sadness is a facade.

You want this.

You need this.

Find someone.

Rend them.

Stain this gray world with color and music again.

…

Then again.

You’ve been annoyingly persistent.

…

And worthless.

It’s almost funny.

That you think you actually have a chance.

…

You should just make yourself be the ink.

If you’re so insistent on denying yourself the painter.

…

I’ll gladly take your place.

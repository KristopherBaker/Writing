A Dog?

The party member that rolls the highest perception check spots a dog with a top hat coming from the brush. 
If the party member attempts to direct the party’s attention to it, they all spot a cat with a bowler hat. 
If the party somehow loses sight of it, whether through arguing on what animal it actually is, they will see a parrot with a scarf perched on a nearby tree. 
This cycle continues as long as the party members keep losing sight of the creature, as it transforms into similarly-sized animals.

If a party member is able to suss out that there’s magic afoot, with the appropriate roll, they will discover the creature is wearing a Greater Hat of Disguise. 
Using dispel magic on the creature will reveal that it is actually….just a dog.
Though the breed is different than what was initially seen. 
The creature becomes saddened if its disguise is foiled.

If the party members are cruel enough to attack the creature, it transforms, in plain sight, into a rabbit and runs away. 
If they somehow capture and/or kill it, it will drop a Greater Hat of Disguise. 
Once the magical item is retrieved, a poorly written note can be discovered on the brim: “2 my best frend in the hole wide world”

Yes, I made this to deter murder hobo gameplay.

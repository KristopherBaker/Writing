Wondrous Item: Headband of Headbutting

A headband with a decorative, curved goat horn on each side.
Upon wearing this, the user will have thoughts of goats ramming into each other, having a strong urge to headbutt like they do.

When rolling an unarmed attack, the wearer may choose to do a single, strong headbutt instead as a full round action. Doing so will cause the receiver to roll a fortitude save to not get Confused (10+PL) or Dazed (15+PL), depending on severity of attack.
If the attack succeeds by 5 to 10 over the enemy’s AC, the enemy will have to roll to not get Confused. 
If the attack succeeds by over 10 of the enemy’s AC or is a critical, the enemy will have to roll to not get Dazed.
Both effects last for one round.

The action hurts to perform, so the attacker will receive 1/4 of the unarmed damage dealt, along with falling prone on their back if they critically fail.

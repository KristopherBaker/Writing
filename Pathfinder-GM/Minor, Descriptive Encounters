List of minor, descriptive things.
Just some ideas that can’t really make a full encounter, but would be neat to place in certain environments.

-Construct whose speech is slightly impaired to extend pronunciation of vowels. 
Could be used anywhere, but I like the idea of it being in a library because of the contrast.
“Whaaaaaat boooooooook woooooooouuuuuld yoooooouuuuuuuu liiiiiiikeeeee toooooooooooo cheeeeeeeck oooooooouuuuuuut?”
Successful Knowledge Engineering checks will find out that some kids stuck some gum into its gears, causing it to get momentarily stuck then unstuck when trying to say vowels. 
Dislodging it will have the construct cough out a few gold pieces and it gets used to normal speech. 
Otherwise behaves the same as before.

-Cat that follows the party, but only by rolling. 
If the party is observant (craft magic item), they will notice it’s wearing specially tailored Boots of the Elvenkind on each of its four feet. 
If the party attempts to interact with it and get close, it will leap incredibly high to the top of the nearest building. 
Those knowledgeable in Alchemy will discover that the cat seems to have partaken in someone’s potion of Jump. 
A particularly strong form of it, since it was able to leap to the top of a one story building.
Depending on the party’s actions, they will be constantly followed by a rolling cat while in town, and it will only run away if the party leaves or attempts to grab/interact with it.

-Child keeps shouting “FIREBALL” while flicking out a wand.
It keeps aiming at random targets, shouting it over and over, to the amusement of the people around him.
Some of his slightly-older peers come and jeer at him for trying magic and failing.
After a few dozen attempts, he throws down his wand and shouts “FIREBALL!” while extending his hands.
This time, however, a Firebolt comes out and taps one of the bullies for 1d3 damage. 
It singes a small hole in his pants to reveal bright pink underwear with heart shapes.
The group scurries away in response.
The child, excited, begins to shout louder and faster in hopes of it happening again.
It does not, despite his increased enthusiasm.

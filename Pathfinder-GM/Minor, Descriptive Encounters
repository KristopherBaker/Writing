List of minor, descriptive things.
Just some ideas that can’t really make a full encounter, but would be neat to place in certain environments.

-Construct whose speech is slightly impaired to extend pronunciation of vowels. 
Could be used anywhere, but I like the idea of it being in a library because of the contrast.
“Whaaaaaat boooooooook woooooooouuuuuld yoooooouuuuuuuu liiiiiiikeeeee toooooooooooo cheeeeeeeck oooooooouuuuuuut?”
Successful Knowledge Engineering checks will find out that some kids stuck some gum into its gears, causing it to get momentarily stuck then unstuck when trying to say vowels. 
Dislodging it will have the construct cough out a few gold pieces as it gets used to normal speech. 
Otherwise behaves the same as before.

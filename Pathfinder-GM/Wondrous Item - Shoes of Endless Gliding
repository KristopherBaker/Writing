Wondrous Item - Shoes of Endless Gliding

A pair of slick leather loafers with completely smooth soles. Anything rubbing against the soles oddly produces no friction.

When worn, if the wearer decides to move in a direction, they will continue to move in that direction at a speed of 60 feet per round. 
This movement cannot be stopped unless the wearer collides with something or uses a move/standard action to fall prone. 
Colliding with a wall is uncomfortable, but allows the user to stop without falling prone.
Colliding with any object below waist-level will require an acrobatics check to determine whether or not the wearer is knocked prone (DC 10 if heavier than wearer, DC 15 otherwise).
The user can perform actions while uncontrollably sliding.

Sliding into enemies can be counted as a charge, but will provoke attacks of opportunity where applicable.
Bumping into enemies can potentially knock them prone if the wearer chooses, by rolling CMB.
Failing the roll knocks the user prone.
Otherwise, bumping into enemies can be counted as if hitting a wall.

Due to the nature of the boots, the wearer suffers -5 CMD and acrobatics penalties while sliding.

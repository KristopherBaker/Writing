Wondrous Item: Belt of Sheer Confidence

Just a goofy item that could enable an oddball play style to the game.

A belt that forces the user to stick out their chest and swing their arms as they walk in a confident gait. Everything they do or say is in full confidence, regardless of how wrong they may be proven.

Their speed is halved due to the awkward, unfamiliar strutting, but EVERY roll they make gets a +1 confidence bonus. 
Includes skill and knowledge checks, enabling the ability to roll all of the latter checks, despite potentially knowing nothing about any of the subjects. 
However, they will take an additional -5 penalty for Knowledge checks, save for the ones they have put at least one rank in.
Failing a Knowledge check will have the player insist they are right instead of just claiming they do not know the subject, possibly making it difficult to discern if they rolled high enough for a successful check.
Any physical Skill checks do not take this penalty.

Melee attackers wearing this cannot attack with piercing, as the movement of their arms only allows bludgeoning or slashing. They may choose to roll a 1d3 to determine if the forced swinging helps their attack and damage rolls (1: -5, 2: normal, 3: +5).
While throwing is possible, a d4 must be rolled to simulate timing the throw (1: flings it to the ground, 2: -5 penalty to attack roll, 3: normal throw, 4: +5 to attack roll). The +1 still applies.
Spellcasters wearing this cannot cast any spells that require a Somatic component, as they are forced to swing their arms instead of motioning them in order to cast spells.

If worn in public, they might receive remarks of envy and annoyance from others. Whether that too is a magical effect or just genuine responses is up to interpretation.
If attempting to barter, the wearer may choose to roll a 1d2 to determine if his confidence is enough to garner a discount (1: +15%, 2: -15%).
Taking the belt off will have the user be unable to put it back on for 72 hours.

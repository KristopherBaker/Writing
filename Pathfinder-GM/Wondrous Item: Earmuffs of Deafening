Wondrous Item : Earmuffs of Deafening

Cozy, poofy earmuffs that are probably one size too big for most.

Wearing them prevents the user from hearing anything, but increases their vision Perception checks by 10 and smell Perception checks by 5.
With the wearer unable to make sound-based perception checks, they are unable have others communicate to them by voice, and can talk only to others.
Bearers of the earmuffs tend to have a penchant for shouting, for some reason.

Taking them off renders them useless for 1d4+1 days.
Meta gaming past this limitation will cause the earmuffs to disintegrate.

“I think I hear something…”

“WHAT?”

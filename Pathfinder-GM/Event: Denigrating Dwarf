Event: Denigrating Dwarf

During their travel, the party comes across a disheveled looking dwarf, sitting on a log surrounded by several empty beer mugs and cursing at nothing.
If the party approaches, the dwarf will begin spouting insults towards them and start initiative.
If the party ignores him, he will pass out after a minute of time has passed.

The dwarf does not move, spending his entire turn to fling an insult at the party, randomly targeting a member.
After a round has passed since each insult, the targeted party member must roll a Will save (DC 20).
Those that fail, and are unaware of the magic going on, will suffer a fear effect due to their perceived inadequacies.
Those that succeed will just be mildly annoyed.
Those knowledgeable in Spellcraft will discover that the dwarf is casting Debilitating Speech.

After four rounds of insults, the dwarf will burp loudly and fall backward on the log, passing out and ending combat.

If the dwarf is successfully attacked and loses hit points, he dies immediately.
If the dwarf is somehow cured of his inebriation, he will swiftly apologize to the party and give gold as recompense.
If the party decides to wait out the dwarf’s inebriation and do nothing to alleviate or help with it, he will attempt to leave with a frustrated grumble about kids these days.

Killing the dwarf garners the same reward as healing him, as does pilfering his pockets after he passes out.

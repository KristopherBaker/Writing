Wondrous Item - Beggar’s Hood

An ordinary-looking hood that, when worn, disguises the wearer as a dirt-speckled beggar.
When worn, the item adds a +5 to bluff checks that pertain to asking for the charitable good will of others, whether that involves asking for coin, items, or to do a good-natured task.
Beings that fail to see past the bluff are compelled to do as the hood-wearer asks, so long as it pertains to charity. 
Each ask is a separate Bluff check. 
The bigger the ask, the higher the difficulty. 
Each success on the same creature will increase subsequent Bluff DCs by 2.

Examples, from the perspective of the target, with possible DC checks:
-Giving a few silver pieces or lower will automatically succeed (0)
-Giving food or water is an automatic success (0)
-Giving information is an automatic success if it’s general knowledge (0), require a mild success if lesser known (7), moderate success if it’s limited (15), heavy success if it’s personal and somewhat sensitive (20), extreme success if it’s privileged (25).
-Giving a few gold pieces will require mild success (7)
-Giving a few platinum pieces will require decent success (15)
-Giving a piece of clothing that is currently worn by them will require decent success, if it doesn’t impair their comfort in the weather or make them partially or wholly nude (16)
-Giving a piece of clothing that WILL make them uncomfortable in the current weather, or partially or wholly nude, will require extreme success (25, 25, and 32, respectively)
-Giving their weapon, if they wield one, will require heavy success (20)
-Giving shelter for the night will require heavy success (20)
-Giving a bed in their home to sleep for the night will require extreme success, with a +5 DC added per party member (25 for only self)

Requesting anything valued beyond 100 gp will automatically fail. 
Attempting to accrue that amount through several patrons will rile the ire of nearby pedestrians, disallowing any further Bluff attempts at that location for the next 1d4 + 1 days. 
Attempting to ignore that will cause the local law to become involved.

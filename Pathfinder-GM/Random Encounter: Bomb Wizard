Either as a special encounter in a city, as a performer, or as an enemy the party runs into while traveling on the road.
The person is a “wizard” that throws bombs while pretending that they are magical spells by using sleight of hand.
They use the skill to hide lighting the fuse, disguise what and where the bomb is, and potentially sneakily hide bombs in certain locations in order to pretend there is a spontaneous, magical effect.
Sometimes these bombs and traps are pre-set in order to give the illusion of magic being conjured away from the con-man.

The character’s motivations can work in several ways: as a performer wowing unsuspecting customers, accusing the party during their travels of theft and attempting to find recompense through “magical” threats, or as a bandit attempting to scare the funds out of unsuspecting passerby’s.
Really could go a multitude of ways with a similar personality throughout: a person confidently faking magic through guile, who is self assured that it will work since it has worked on the chumps he duped before.
Of course, when all his tricks are out of the bag, he will likely just grovel for mercy or to plead the party to keep his secret.
Or both.

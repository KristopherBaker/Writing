Wondrous Item: Wheat of Wit

An unassuming straw of wheat that, when placed in one’s mouth, will cause the bearer to speak in a deep, southern drawl.
Any check related to speech is increased by 3 while in use.
The straw gets worn over time, and can only be chewed/used for approximately 1d20+10 checks.

If the player does not speak in a southern drawl, the effect is wasted.

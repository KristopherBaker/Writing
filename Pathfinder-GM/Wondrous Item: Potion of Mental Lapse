Wondrous Item - Potion of Mental Lapsing

A vaporous potion that causes the affected creature to essentially have a brain fart. 
They will be dazed for a single turn if they fail a will save (15).
In actuality, the potion stops time for a very brief moment, for less than a second, but enough for a creature to be disoriented briefly.

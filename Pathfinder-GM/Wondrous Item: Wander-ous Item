Wondrous Item: Wander-ous Item

An item that, when noticed, will move away out of sight when it is no longer looked at.
Item can be anything, but has the “Wander-ous” flavor text instead of Wondrous.
Serves no purpose other than to annoy a potential owner.
If found and contained, it is worth a decent amount of gold for its novelty.
But most easily underestimate its escape abilities.

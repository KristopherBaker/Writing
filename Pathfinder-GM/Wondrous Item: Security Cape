Wondrous Item: Security Cape

An overly-flowing cape that weighs its wearer down, but provides comfort.

Donning it reduces move speed by 5 feet, but allows the user to cover themselves in the thick material as a standard action.
Whisking the cape around themselves provides complete immunity to fear-effects and expels existing ones from the wearer, while providing +8 deflect AC as if assuming a Total Defense stance.

Covering and uncovering takes a standard action for each.
When covered, the user can only do free actions until uncovered.

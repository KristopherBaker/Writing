Wondrous Item: Ring of Things

This kaleidoscope-like ring twists and turns around the user’s finger, influencing the wearer’s skills very slightly in their favor. 
Either through their memories, or summoning a very small trinket or booklet, does this ring provide aid.

This ring provides a +2 bonus to all skill checks.

If placed on one’s finger, it needs time to adjust to its new owner, requiring a full day until fully activated.

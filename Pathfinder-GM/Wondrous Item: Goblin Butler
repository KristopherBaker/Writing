Wondrous Item - Servant Bell, Minor
A dainty silver bell that, when rung, is will cause a goblin dressed in finery to appear from behind the closest out-of-sight corner.
I.e if you ring it in a forest, it appears from behind a tree where no one can see. If rung in a house, it will come in from another room where no one was present.

The goblin will inquire as to what the bell ringer wishes to have for a drink that day. 
The ringer may request a level 1 potion of any kind if their character level is between 1-3, level 2 for cl 4-7, level 3 for cl 8-11 etc.
The ringer may request higher leveled potions, with the caveat that they may be botched (+20% for every level range beyond the level of the potion requested). 
The goblin butler will warn of potions that may be more difficult to brew himself, with increasing severity depending on the mischance. (Examples, 1 range: “That’s a slightly challenging ask for now, sir, but I might be able to brew something….with a chance of mild impurities”. 2 range: “That’s a difficult ask, there is a chance I might fail, sir.” 3: “My apologies, there is a great chance I may fail this request. May I suggest [potion in level range”

Soon after the request is made, the goblin disappears when he walks out of sight from the party for 1d4 turns. 
A faint sound of clinking glasses, pouring liquids, and tumbling of ice can be heard before the butler appears again, with the potion in a pristine, cooled tumbler glass. 
The ringer may suggest a to-go container for the potion.
The goblin may only be beckoned once a day at level 1-7, twice at level 8-12, thrice beyond that.

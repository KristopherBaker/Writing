Event: Darkness Ambush

The party comes across an abandoned home, moderately unkempt.
The main door is locked with a simple, flimsy lock. 
Opening and investigating will find that it is decently furnished, albeit neglected.
It has all the trappings that will allow the party to comfortably long rest.

If the party investigates the house, they will find nothing unusual until they search the cellar.
The door leading to it is also locked with a simple tumbler.
Unlocking or breaking it open will reveal a dim light emanating from around a corner.
Further investigation will lead to a weirdly dimmed candle in the center of the main room.
If Perception checks are stellar and breaks the hiding assassins’ Stealth, combat begins.
If attempting to Detect Magic, the candle will be the only thing magical that is detected.
If approaching the candle, the victim will be shrouded in Darkness.
If the assassins were not discovered when a party member is wandering in the Darkness, they will attempt to paralyze and bind them after 3 turns of failed Perception checks.
If at any point they are discovered, combat begins.

If the party does not investigate the house further and decides to rest, they will be ambushed by silent assassins. 
If the party keeps a sentry awake while the others sleep, two dark figures will be exposed creeping up from the cellar door.
If no sentry is awake, the party will perform difficult Perception checks to detect hostiles, barring certain feats.
The assassins intend to bring the party in alive, so they will attempt to slowly incapacitate and bind them one by one.
After 3 failed Perception checks by each member, one of the party will be paralyzed at random.
Within the next two turns the attacked will be bound as the other assassin continues to the next.
Perception checks become easier as the assassins progress.
Succeeding immediately starts combat.

Once the house is cleared, it will be a completely safe place for a long rest.

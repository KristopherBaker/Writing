Alchemist’s Dare

Alchemist that dares the party to try one of his strongest potions. 
If any of the party takes the dare and makes the appropriate Fortitude save (24), they will resist it. Failing will make the party member go prone and tuck their lips into their mouth, taking 10 non-lethal damage (a bad tummy ache).
Modest rolls in Alchemy (10+) will reveal that the “potion” is merely extremely concentrated lemon juice.
Either discovering the secret or succeeding the Fortitude check will garner some gold pieces for the party. If the former, the Alchemist gives it due to being impressed, but saddened it wasn’t as strong as he wanted it. If the latter, he gives the funds in order to make the party keep quiet in the simplicity of his concoction.

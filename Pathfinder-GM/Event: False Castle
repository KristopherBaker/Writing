Event: False Castle

The party rolls Will saves.

Those that fail find that they have stumbled upon a magnificent castle, with a wide open drawbridge.
Despite its opulence, there are no other visible subjects around; it’s merely only a castle with no township or neighboring structures.

People that didn’t fail the Will save will find that there is no castle, but a bunch of scrap and rubble surrounded by quicksand.

Those knowledgeable in Spellcraft will find that someone malicious attempted to glamor a piece of the scrap in order to lure others to their demise.
Whoever devised it is not around, however.

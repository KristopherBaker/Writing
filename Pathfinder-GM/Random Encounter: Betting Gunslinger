A random encounter where the party meets a gunslinger that takes bets on what to shoot.
Depending on the difficulty, he might decline or increase the betting odds, as well as limit the amount of challenges due to his grit pool being expended.
For example, he will always take a challenge on any still target within 200 feet, but may decline moving or hidden targets further away.
Regardless, he will agree to shoot anything in any state within 90 feet (Roving Range increasing range increment by 5 feet per).
If the size of the object is smaller than a gold piece and is further than 45 feet, he may hesitate to accept.
For perspective, anything within 45 feet he will have a 95% chance to hit it. 75% if itâ€™s a far smaller item. Every 45 feet he will have to expend grit points to not take as much of a detriment to his chances.

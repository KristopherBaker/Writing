Gunslinger Bets

A random encounter where the party meets a gunslinger that takes bets on what to shoot.
Depending on the difficulty, he might decline or increase the betting odds, as well as limit the amount of challenges due to his grit pool being expended.
For example, he will always take a challenge on any still target within 200 feet, but may decline moving or hidden targets further away.
Regardless, he will agree to shoot anything in any state within 90 feet (Roving Range increasing range increment by 5 feet per).
If the size of the object is smaller than a gold piece and is further than 45 feet, he may hesitate to accept.
For perspective, anything within 45 feet he will have a 95% chance to hit it. 75% if it’s a far smaller item. Every 45 feet he will have to expend grit points to not take as much of a detriment to his chances.

The gunslinger will typically take money for bets, but may take an item of similar value. 
Depending on the difficulty of the bet, he may return up to 3 times the value of the offered item.
If offered a living creature, he will decline.
If offered a living humanoid, he will vehemently decline and possibly not accept future bets from the party, depending on the context of the offer.
If given too many chances for bets, grit pool willing and if close enough to a town, local authorities may stop the bets due to a noise violation ordinance. Though this is to keep a party from potentially getting too lucky against the gunslinger.

The party may be able to interfere with the bets into their favor. 
Examples include (but not limited to) using invisible means to tamper with targets he’s aiming at, sneakily replacing his ammunition with blanks, or illusion to make it appear he didn’t hit something he landed), but the gunslinger will not tolerate cheating and consider it a win in his favor if he perceives any foul play.
Afterwards he will stop taking bets from the party since he is aware that they cheat.

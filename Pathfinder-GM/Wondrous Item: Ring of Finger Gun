Wondrous Item: Ring of Finger Gun

Wearers of the ring feel a strong urge to point their finger at something and shout various, gun-like onomatopoeias.

A magical ring that can be invoked by pointing towards anything and shouting “bang!”, “pew!”, “pow!”, or similar onomatopoeias as a standard action.
Doing so shoots out a single magic missile towards the target.
Both actions must be performed in order to invoke, as only pointing or only shouting does nothing.

Variants of this ring exist up to +6, with 6 missiles being the maximum amount conjured per turn. 
The ring can be invoked 3 times a day.

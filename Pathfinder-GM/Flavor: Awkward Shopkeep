More of just flavor instead of an actual encounter.

The shopkeep is very short, almost like a gremlin, but otherwise has human-like features. Though said features are smooth and slimy looking, as if he puts on too much lotion. Voice is similar to Stitch, but is generally well-mannered. Wears a dress suit and bolo tie, though the former appears to be tailored a bit longer and hangs above the knees of his dress pants.
Any questions about his demeanor is usually met with a reply mentioning how his wife, who is a very normal and homely human being, prefers it that way. If pressed, he will change his voice to something more pleasing and normal after a series of deep coughs.

If threatened, he pulls out a battleaxe that’s almost twice his size from behind his back, seemingly from nowhere.
His wares are very unassuming and are typical to what you’d normally see in any other shop. 
The only thing out of place is him, but he tries to not act strangely on purpose despite the times where there are small hiccups in modicum. I.e. saying “yes” at the end of his sentences, oddly suggesting simple actions (“I love drinking water, I hope you drink water too.”), or small flourishes/twitches out of nowhere.

Again, not an actual encounter. This is just to add flavor if the campaign needs it and the players want a little more beyond stat/equipment swap moments.

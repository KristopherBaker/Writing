Event: Inept Assassin

A type of ongoing flavor event that occurs several times throughout the campaign.
Partially inspired by Team Rocket’s Jesse and James.

There is an assassin that follows the party after they have gained some fame.
They will attempt to slay one of the party members, but are always off by just enough to either fall flat on their face or accidentally attack a bystander, who then has them roughed up in retaliation.

Each time the assassin fails, a considerable amount of money spills and spreads around his point of failure; i.e. when they jump from a rooftop in an attempt to plunge a dagger into a party member, they fall onto the stone road and coins blast around their body due to landing on their purse instead.

If the party searches the assassin, they will find a letter stating a mysterious person (anonymized as an initial) that wishes the party dead, and stressing that the letter must be burned after being read.

Every subsequent letter found in future encounters becomes more brief and dismissive, chiding the assassin about not disposing of the letters. Eventually the letters get so small that the last one simply says “KILL. THEM.” in hurried, angry penstrokes.

In the last encounter, the assassin directly makes themselves known before the party and attempts to attack them upfront, before tripping and falling flat on their face, knocking them out.
After this encounter, the party may find the assassin working as a farm hand, giving up their life of (supposed) killing.
The party may observe that the former assassin still trips, but gets himself up this time instead of getting knocked out.

The party may decide to kill the assassin at any point, but that’s no fun.
If they do, they can filch the boots that have the word “lucky” engraved on the soles.
Doing a spellcraft check will reveal that the boots are cursed and decease acrobatics by 20.

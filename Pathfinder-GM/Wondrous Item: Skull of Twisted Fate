Wondrous Item - Skull of Twisted Fate

Inspired by Skull of Mondain from Ultima 4.

A skull emanating either a pure evil or pure  good, depending on the alignment of who holds it.
If the holder is evil, it will Heal and Resurrect everyone within 50 feet, but completely shift their alignment to the exact opposite of what they currently are.
If the holder is good, it will kill everyone except the holder within 50 feet, as well as shifting their alignment to the exact opposite.
The skull crumbles to dust after one use.

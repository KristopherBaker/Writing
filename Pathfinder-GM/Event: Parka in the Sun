Event: Parka in the Sun

The party comes across a man dressed very heavily for winter weather, sitting on a stump and sniveling.
However, the weather is far from cold, as the sun is making the day pleasantly warm.

If the party decides to approach, the man will proceed to sneeze.
As soon as he does, a heavy blizzard covers the entire area for 1 turn.
He apologizes after the blizzard dissipates, stating that he’s a little under the weather.
The man will continue to sneeze every 1d6 + 3 rounds.

Note that while he appears to be unaffected by it, the blizzard can harm the party if unprepared.
He’s essentially casting Blizzard Effect Word with every sneeze.

If the party cures the man, he will happily give the party a couple bottles of his favorite drink, Ice Floe Elixir, along with a generous sum of coins.
After being cured, he immediately rips off his parka to reveal a flowery shirt and swim trunks, exiting the area with enthusiasm.

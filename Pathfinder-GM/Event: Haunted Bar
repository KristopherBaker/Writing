Event: Haunted Bar
Could take place anywhere abandoned.

The party encounters a bar within a decrepit building. 
Upon approaching it, a barkeep will appear from behind the counter.
He will ask if anyone would like a drink, despite everything around him in mostly ruin.
Perception checks will reveal a concerning, singed hole in his hat.
The bartender will answer no question until he has served a drink.
Anyone may ask for any type of beverage or potion, and the bartender will have a chance to serve it.
There’s a 75% chance that it’s what was ordered.
There’s a 25% chance that it’s poison.
As soon as someone has a drink, the bartender becomes more open to conversation.
He will divulge in the state of his establishment, regaling finer days when a large swath of personalities would flow in and out.
He will tell of a time when he wasn’t a bartender, of a dirty profession he wanted to escape from.
The bartender reveals his suspicions that it caught up to him, when patrons commented that his spirits seemed to taste a little off.
It wasn’t until one of the patrons accused him of poisoning his drinks that it was too late.
In a fit of rage one of his patrons shot him where he stood. His establishment known for treachery ever since.
Players knowledgeable of these sorts of encounter will reveal that they have been exposed to a Haunt.
